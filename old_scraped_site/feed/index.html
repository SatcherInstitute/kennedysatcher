<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCBcRXC8xmw"><button>Watch the 988 Leadership Summit</button></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><span class="JsGRdQ">The current emergency response system was not designed to meet the needs of those in behavioral health crisis. First responders are not equipped with training necessary to expertly intervene. Inadequate interventions occur too frequently for people in distress, and the consequences of this are increased trauma and inequity. Specific communities have experienced the most inequity and trauma: people who identify as LGBTQIA+; black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC); rural communities; immigrants, refugees, and non-English speaking people; people living with disabilities; older adults; people experiencing homelessness or housing instability; formerly incarcerated or justice-involved populations; survivors of trauma; and neurodiverse people. Evidence shows these populations hesitate to call 911 in times of need because they fear the response will result in more harm than good (Sasson, et.al, 2015). This July, the United States will launch the first ever national emergency line devoted to psychiatric response and preparedness: 988. A historic time in healthcare, it is an opportunity for local and federal leaders to employ necessary tools that ensure previous experiences and failures are rectified and its implementation is equitable.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><span class="JsGRdQ">To address this, the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), an entity of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine has partnered with Beacon Health Options, to establish concrete recommendations towards equitable and effective administration of 988. This has been done through a comprehensive literature review to understand the context of inequity in psychiatric response, and complemented with a leadership experience survey that was anonymously responded to by dozens of leaders in the behavioral health field across the country. Each recommendation also has opportunities for exploration and measurement of success into the future. Efforts to embed equity into 988 must be continuous and comprehensive.</span></p>

<p>Madhuri Jha, director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity, has been in the trenches of mental healthcare. Jha spent years working in New York City mobile crisis response vans. She met clients in crisis wherever they felt comfortable – from McDonald’s bathrooms to public parks – and connected them with the medication, resources or higher care they needed. Now, she uses her on-the-ground experience to promote health equity for underserved populations, including BIPOC. Jha shares her thoughts on why improving access to mental health care is not enough, and how to build a holistic, healing health system for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If You’re Feeling Numb and You Think This is Normal, Something is Very Wrong</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month 2022</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>By: Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/hers), Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity advocates for the safety and well-being of all because access to safety and well-being should be seen as a basic civil right. Mental Health Awareness Month is when we call upon our mental health system to identify solutions so safety and wellbeing outcomes can improve. This month alone there have been three separate incidents of mass shootings in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-15/buffalo-shooting-that-killed-10-investigated-as-racially-motivated-violent-extremism">10 African-Americans murdered in Buffalo</a> in a racially motivated shooting crime at a grocery store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-15/multiple-people-shot-at-church-in-laguna-woods-o-c-sheriff-says">5 Asian-Americans critically injured</a> in a shooting crime at their church in California.</p>
<p>And this week, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/25/1101071658/what-we-know-about-uvalde-shooting">21 people, 19 young children and 2 adult teachers, in Uvalde, Texas</a>, murdered at their school by an 18 year old who purchased a rifle on his birthday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081">No other country in the world experiences mass incidents of violence and racism like we do here in the United States</a>. I am concerned that policies have historically seen the mental health system as the remedy to the complex trauma and rage that our society is burdened with due to exposure to such violence. It’s time we started treating violence and racism as public health and national security crises.</p>
<p>The news cycle has rekindled a memory of a case I was assigned some years ago. He was a middle-aged male of Puerto Rican descent, recently released from prison on parole. Within a few sessions, his psychiatrist and I became aware that he was pharma-seeking, as he kept “losing” his clonazepam supply and would appear to appointments under the influence. In response to being told he was not going to receive any more controlled medications, he stated he would bring an assault rifle to the clinic, and I was his target. I was not allowed to go to work for a week, while law enforcement discovered he had indeed illegally acquired weapons. He was quickly arrested and sent back to prison.</p>
<p>This story haunts me for many reasons. He had been in and out carceral facilities since he was 9 years old. I met him when he was 53. I’m haunted that someone could spend 44 years of their life knowing nothing but carceral settings. I am also haunted by the fact that we narrowly avoided a mass shooting at my clinic, and then went back to work and pretended like it never happened.</p>
<p>Too many of us have stories like this. We have been both numbed and conditioned to normalize these incidents, just as we have been numbed and conditioned to <a href="https://www.hurdle.health/2022-report">normalize mass incarceration and police violence.</a> Numbness and the impulse to normalize are signs of exposure to prolonged traumatic stress. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1101050970/2022-school-shootings-so-far">27 school shootings have taken place this year</a>, and there have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/15/1099008586/mass-shootings-us-2022-tally-number">199 mass shootings this year in total</a>. Only halfway into 2022, the US is averaging about 10 incidents a week. Where do we find the capacity to heal when the credible threat of trauma is constant? How do we as healers heal ourselves in lightning speed, so we can continue to be healers for our patients and students?</p>
<p>I remember in 2018, when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2018/03/us/student-walkout-cnnphotos/">children across the country walked out of school and marched to Capitol Hill</a>, demanding reforms to ensure there was school safety and stricter policies for accessing weapons after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-respond-shooting-parkland-florida-high-school-n848101">the horrific tragedy in Parkland, Florida.</a> I also remember the brown and black teen clients who came into therapy that night distraught because their public schools didn’t take their walkout seriously. One said, “Why don’t these powerful people care that there are guns in our schools every day? Do they think this is supposed to be normal for us?” I struggled to have words for those grieving kids that night. I hugged every single one of them.</p>
<p>May 25th is the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder. And in two years, despite all the momentum advocates have gained to address reform, we have been unsuccessful in being able to pass any legislation that addresses mass violence. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the House, and then collapsed last September, when negotiations from both parties in the Senate could not reach consensus. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/gun-laws-us-congress/index.html">HR 1446</a> is a bill that passed in the House that closes the “Charleston Loophole”, which would ensure gun sales cannot proceed without background checks being completed. But it is also stalled in the Senate.  That loophole is the reason why Dylan Roof was able to legally purchase a firearm and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/15/505723552/jury-finds-dylann-roof-guilty-in-s-c-church-shooting">kill nine people at a historically black church</a> in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.</p>
<p>Here’s what I implore this Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month: we must stop seeing solutions in a silo and recognize that they are systemic. At the Kennedy-Satcher Center, we pledge to ensure that every conversation held towards policy change, is backed with concrete, intersectional evidence that it is necessary. Children should not believe this is normal. Parents should never have to suffer a trauma like those in Texas are experiencing right now. Teachers and providers should not have to go back to work and pretend like these things don’t happen to them. We must change our approaches to policy reform because it can be life-saving.</p>

<blockquote><p>Madhuri Jha, director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity at the Morehouse School of Medicine, witnessed how COVID impacted unhoused people with serious mental illness when she led a mobile behavioral health unit in New York City early in the pandemic. “It wasn&#8217;t just death” that increased when the pandemic hit, she says. “It was accidental overdose, suicide, incarceration. It was people going missing and no way to account for it.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>New Initiative to Define Policy Recommendations for Embedding Equity into 988</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atlanta, GA – May 11, 2022- Today, the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), an entity of the Satcher Health Leadership at Morehouse School of Medicine, announces a new initiative in partnership with Beacon Health Options (Beacon): <em>Embedding Equity into 988: Imagining a New Normal for Crisis Response. </em>This research and policy initiative will imagine equitable crisis response for the future of behavioral health service delivery ahead of the July 2022 launch of 988, a national crisis line that will serve as a “911” for psychiatric emergencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have been witness to a 911 call going badly for someone in crisis. It is the type of mental image that stays with you forever in this line of work,” said KSCMHE Director and practicing clinician, Madhuri Jha, LSCW, MPH, who is also spearheading this initiative. “Our current psychiatric emergency response system fails to adequately meet the needs of our most vulnerable. For Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and other historically marginalized communities, 988 is an opportunity to ensure our system is saving and treating lives the way all humans deserve to be treated. From an evidence-based perspective, we will thoughtfully craft concrete and culturally responsive recommendations and evaluation measures to ensure that this significant moment in history advances equity the way it truly has the potential to do,” emphasized Jha.</p>

<p><em>Embedding Equity into 988</em> will conduct a rapid academic review and survey assessment to inform a policy brief that will outline a series of detailed recommendations for effective and equitable administration of 988. This policy brief will be complemented with a virtual half-day leadership summit on June 21, 2022, where leaders in behavioral healthcare will discuss the equitable roll-out of 988 with the objective of defining strategies to address the unmet needs in crisis response, especially for historically marginalized people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. David Satcher, former 16th U.S. Surgeon General and founder of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute shared, “Over the years, I have seen people of color dismissed and not get the care they need or deserved. Our crisis and emergency response system simply does not know how to respond to diverse needs or are just negligent at times. This partnership and concentrated effort to make 988 equitable is bringing to light what is needed to respond and support the needs of all in a way that works. The goal for embedding equitable response structures into 988 is to truly provide our community members with the support they need versus doing more harm. This initiative and partnership aims to do just that.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Actualizing equitable mental health service delivery is long overdue in our nation,” stated former U.S. Rep. and co-founder of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity, Patrick J. Kennedy. “Although having a dedicated crisis line for mental health emergencies is a major step in the right direction, ensuring we can provide the appropriate services to everyone, as part of its roll out, will be critical to its long-term success. I am grateful to Beacon Health Options for partnering with us to shine a spotlight on this issue.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This collaboration and initiative is a monumental opportunity for the advancement towards equitable healthcare for our nation. Structural barriers to equitable healthcare and the resulting inequities from these barriers, while daunting, are not permanent,” said, Satcher Health Leadership Institute’s Executive Director, Daniel Dawes, J.D.  “The work we are doing now to embed equity into the upcoming 988 crisis line is a leap towards dissolving these politically-determined barriers and the start to a more permanent, equitable, and holistic healthcare system.  I am thrilled at the opportunity for the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Beacon Health Options to join forces in this important work.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the nation moves closer to the national launch of 988, Beacon has been working closely with states to elevate the level of care they are able to provide through responsive crisis programs. Beacon’s team of experts include individuals with clinical and lived experience to support people in crisis in communities across the country, working collaboratively to identify and address public health needs and build capacity of local resources.  Together, they support people throughout their crisis journey and improve health equity for historically marginalized and underserved communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Beacon will continue to deliver capabilities that will help address gaps in services and resources in our communities,” said Glenn MacFarlane, President, Beacon Health Options. “We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with KSCMHE on this initiative to ensure we are helping communities build better crisis systems based on a foundation of equity and capable of responding to the unique needs and experiences of each individual.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>On Being “Strengths-Based” and Having “Thick Skin”</strong></p>
<p>By Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/hers), Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The start of the year feels like a social media sprint through the first few annual “awareness months.” Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and before we know it, <a href="https://kennedysatcher.org/kscmhe-pulse/blog/mental-health-equity-is-health-equity/">Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month</a>. As a leader in the equity space, for me, awareness months can be both motivational and overwhelming. Inequity is so intersectional in nature. It is persistently challenging to simplify scope. While it is widely known that oppression has influenced and caused deficiencies, I find that our historical records are not <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/strength-based-therapy">strengths-based</a> enough. A study conducted in<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/"> 2016</a> illuminated that many doctors exhibit racially biased and false beliefs that pain tolerance is biologically different between blacks and whites &#8212; quite simply, that black people have “thicker skin” than white people do. Evidence shows that in the United States, the foundations of these beliefs stemmed from the documented actions of pro-slavery physicians, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/racial-differences-doctors.html">Thomas Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3106.html">Samuel A. Cartwright</a>, the notorious source of the psychiatric diagnosis “drapetomania.” The way the American medical system has told women of color, specifically, to have “thick skin” perpetuates harmful narratives that influence their experiences accessing care. In my psychotherapy practice, my client base is predominantly female survivors of trauma. A humbling and important reminder of what it means to be strengths-based, I spend two nights a week striking a balance between giving my clients a space for their trauma narrative, while cultivating acknowledgment that they are powerful, capable, and brilliant. Closing Women’s History Month, I wonder how our narratives would shift if we approached evaluating, researching, and defining equity for mothers and daughters from a more strengths-based perspective?</p>
<p><em>The Mothers and Daughters of </em><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/attachment-theory/"><em>Understanding Attachment.</em></a> There are demonstrated research efforts to understand the impact of colonial and intergenerational trauma in American Indian/Alaska Native women. But only recently, have we begun to appropriately reckon with many, related traumatic realities they face – like, for example, the traumatic impact of forcible separation of children from their mothers due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6241300/">Compulsory Boarding School Policies</a>. While recent news has been rocked by discovery of frequent sexual abuse and unmarked graves of thousands of children who were forced to attend these schools, we must honor that we know about these stories only because of the bravery and resiliency of those who survived them, like <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/10/03/stories-of-life-in-indian-boarding-schools">Denise Lajimodiere (Ojibwe)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V6ewzenbk4">Yvonne Walker-Keshik (Odawa)</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Mothers and Daughters of Gynecological Wellness. </em>In 1934, the New York Academy of Medicine installed a statue in Central Park of Dr. J. Marion Sims. Dubbed by some as the “father of surgical gynecology,” the statue commemorated his scientific achievements in techniques to repair female reproductive organ dysfunction. Some years later, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563360/">Journal of Medical Ethics</a> exposed he developed these techniques by experimenting on enslaved black women, without the use of anesthesia. While we do not know the names of many of the victims, via Sims’ logs, we know the names of three: <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/02/recognizing-lucy-betsey-and-anarcha">Anarcha, Lucy and Betsey</a>. The records of the three women showed that they not only repeatedly healed each other but developed concepts of gynecological and surgical nursing that are still practiced today. In 2018, the New York City mayor <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/17/603163394/-father-of-gynecology-who-experimented-on-slaves-no-longer-on-pedestal-in-nyc">had the statue of Sims removed,</a> acknowledging that failing to honor the legacies of these women was a systemic injustice. Ironically in that same year, one of the greatest athletes of all time, Serena Williams, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018">was initially not believed by doctors</a>, when she could sense that her history with blood clots had resurfaced during her pregnancy. She harrowingly escaped maternal mortality while giving birth to her daughter Olympia and <a href="https://thesource.com/2018/05/29/serena-williams-grand-slam/">won the French Open</a> just eight months post-delivery.</p>
<p>Much evidence shows that women are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression/art-20047725">twice more likely</a> to be diagnosed with depression than men. Rates of depression and anxiety in Black, Latina, and American Indian/Alaska Native women, however, are higher than their white female counterparts. They are also less likely to seek care. It is arguable that BIPOC women are hesitant to seek outside help because they have been met with such historically traumatic and biased outcomes. And when one reflects on the stories outlined above, and countless others like them, it is harmful, and sometimes life-threatening, to purport that someone’s race or gender, or both, is the primary risk factor or cause for disease or mental illness. The inclusion of champions of healing and resilience in the way we define health and mental health is critical and paramount to advancing equity. We must find means to ensure that understanding barriers to access is complemented by the intentional evaluation, research, and creation of policies based on existing resiliency. For an equitable future, our records must never again doubt that mothers and daughters, especially those of color, are powerful, capable, and brilliant.</p>
