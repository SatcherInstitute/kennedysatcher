<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month 2022</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>By: Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/hers), Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity advocates for the safety and well-being of all because access to safety and well-being should be seen as a basic civil right. Mental Health Awareness Month is when we call upon our mental health system to identify solutions so safety and wellbeing outcomes can improve. This month alone there have been three separate incidents of mass shootings in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-15/buffalo-shooting-that-killed-10-investigated-as-racially-motivated-violent-extremism">10 African-Americans murdered in Buffalo</a> in a racially motivated shooting crime at a grocery store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-15/multiple-people-shot-at-church-in-laguna-woods-o-c-sheriff-says">5 Asian-Americans critically injured</a> in a shooting crime at their church in California.</p>
<p>And this week, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/25/1101071658/what-we-know-about-uvalde-shooting">21 people, 19 young children and 2 adult teachers, in Uvalde, Texas</a>, murdered at their school by an 18 year old who purchased a rifle on his birthday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081">No other country in the world experiences mass incidents of violence and racism like we do here in the United States</a>. I am concerned that policies have historically seen the mental health system as the remedy to the complex trauma and rage that our society is burdened with due to exposure to such violence. It’s time we started treating violence and racism as public health and national security crises.</p>
<p>The news cycle has rekindled a memory of a case I was assigned some years ago. He was a middle-aged male of Puerto Rican descent, recently released from prison on parole. Within a few sessions, his psychiatrist and I became aware that he was pharma-seeking, as he kept “losing” his clonazepam supply and would appear to appointments under the influence. In response to being told he was not going to receive any more controlled medications, he stated he would bring an assault rifle to the clinic, and I was his target. I was not allowed to go to work for a week, while law enforcement discovered he had indeed illegally acquired weapons. He was quickly arrested and sent back to prison.</p>
<p>This story haunts me for many reasons. He had been in and out carceral facilities since he was 9 years old. I met him when he was 53. I’m haunted that someone could spend 44 years of their life knowing nothing but carceral settings. I am also haunted by the fact that we narrowly avoided a mass shooting at my clinic, and then went back to work and pretended like it never happened.</p>
<p>Too many of us have stories like this. We have been both numbed and conditioned to normalize these incidents, just as we have been numbed and conditioned to <a href="https://www.hurdle.health/2022-report">normalize mass incarceration and police violence.</a> Numbness and the impulse to normalize are signs of exposure to prolonged traumatic stress. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1101050970/2022-school-shootings-so-far">27 school shootings have taken place this year</a>, and there have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/15/1099008586/mass-shootings-us-2022-tally-number">199 mass shootings this year in total</a>. Only halfway into 2022, the US is averaging about 10 incidents a week. Where do we find the capacity to heal when the credible threat of trauma is constant? How do we as healers heal ourselves in lightning speed, so we can continue to be healers for our patients and students?</p>
<p>I remember in 2018, when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2018/03/us/student-walkout-cnnphotos/">children across the country walked out of school and marched to Capitol Hill</a>, demanding reforms to ensure there was school safety and stricter policies for accessing weapons after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-respond-shooting-parkland-florida-high-school-n848101">the horrific tragedy in Parkland, Florida.</a> I also remember the brown and black teen clients who came into therapy that night distraught because their public schools didn’t take their walkout seriously. One said, “Why don’t these powerful people care that there are guns in our schools every day? Do they think this is supposed to be normal for us?” I struggled to have words for those grieving kids that night. I hugged every single one of them.</p>
<p>May 25th is the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder. And in two years, despite all the momentum advocates have gained to address reform, we have been unsuccessful in being able to pass any legislation that addresses mass violence. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the House, and then collapsed last September, when negotiations from both parties in the Senate could not reach consensus. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/gun-laws-us-congress/index.html">HR 1446</a> is a bill that passed in the House that closes the “Charleston Loophole”, which would ensure gun sales cannot proceed without background checks being completed. But it is also stalled in the Senate.  That loophole is the reason why Dylan Roof was able to legally purchase a firearm and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/15/505723552/jury-finds-dylann-roof-guilty-in-s-c-church-shooting">kill nine people at a historically black church</a> in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.</p>
<p>Here’s what I implore this Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month: we must stop seeing solutions in a silo and recognize that they are systemic. At the Kennedy-Satcher Center, we pledge to ensure that every conversation held towards policy change, is backed with concrete, intersectional evidence that it is necessary. Children should not believe this is normal. Parents should never have to suffer a trauma like those in Texas are experiencing right now. Teachers and providers should not have to go back to work and pretend like these things don’t happen to them. We must change our approaches to policy reform because it can be life-saving.</p>

<blockquote><p>Madhuri Jha, director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity at the Morehouse School of Medicine, witnessed how COVID impacted unhoused people with serious mental illness when she led a mobile behavioral health unit in New York City early in the pandemic. “It wasn&#8217;t just death” that increased when the pandemic hit, she says. “It was accidental overdose, suicide, incarceration. It was people going missing and no way to account for it.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>New Initiative to Define Policy Recommendations for Embedding Equity into 988</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atlanta, GA – May 11, 2022- Today, the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), an entity of the Satcher Health Leadership at Morehouse School of Medicine, announces a new initiative in partnership with Beacon Health Options (Beacon): <em>Embedding Equity into 988: Imagining a New Normal for Crisis Response. </em>This research and policy initiative will imagine equitable crisis response for the future of behavioral health service delivery ahead of the July 2022 launch of 988, a national crisis line that will serve as a “911” for psychiatric emergencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have been witness to a 911 call going badly for someone in crisis. It is the type of mental image that stays with you forever in this line of work,” said KSCMHE Director and practicing clinician, Madhuri Jha, LSCW, MPH, who is also spearheading this initiative. “Our current psychiatric emergency response system fails to adequately meet the needs of our most vulnerable. For Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and other historically marginalized communities, 988 is an opportunity to ensure our system is saving and treating lives the way all humans deserve to be treated. From an evidence-based perspective, we will thoughtfully craft concrete and culturally responsive recommendations and evaluation measures to ensure that this significant moment in history advances equity the way it truly has the potential to do,” emphasized Jha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Embedding Equity into 988</em> will conduct a rapid academic review and survey assessment to inform a policy brief that will outline a series of detailed recommendations for effective and equitable administration of 988. This policy brief will be complemented with a virtual half-day leadership summit on June 21, 2022, where leaders in behavioral healthcare will discuss the equitable roll-out of 988 with the objective of defining strategies to address the unmet needs in crisis response, especially for historically marginalized people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. David Satcher, former 16th U.S. Surgeon General and founder of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute shared, “Over the years, I have seen people of color dismissed and not get the care they need or deserved. Our crisis and emergency response system simply does not know how to respond to diverse needs or are just negligent at times. This partnership and concentrated effort to make 988 equitable is bringing to light what is needed to respond and support the needs of all in a way that works. The goal for embedding equitable response structures into 988 is to truly provide our community members with the support they need versus doing more harm. This initiative and partnership aims to do just that.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Actualizing equitable mental health service delivery is long overdue in our nation,” stated former U.S. Rep. and co-founder of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity, Patrick J. Kennedy. “Although having a dedicated crisis line for mental health emergencies is a major step in the right direction, ensuring we can provide the appropriate services to everyone, as part of its roll out, will be critical to its long-term success. I am grateful to Beacon Health Options for partnering with us to shine a spotlight on this issue.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This collaboration and initiative is a monumental opportunity for the advancement towards equitable healthcare for our nation. Structural barriers to equitable healthcare and the resulting inequities from these barriers, while daunting, are not permanent,” said, Satcher Health Leadership Institute’s Executive Director, Daniel Dawes, J.D.  “The work we are doing now to embed equity into the upcoming 988 crisis line is a leap towards dissolving these politically-determined barriers and the start to a more permanent, equitable, and holistic healthcare system.  I am thrilled at the opportunity for the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Beacon Health Options to join forces in this important work.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the nation moves closer to the national launch of 988, Beacon has been working closely with states to elevate the level of care they are able to provide through responsive crisis programs. Beacon’s team of experts include individuals with clinical and lived experience to support people in crisis in communities across the country, working collaboratively to identify and address public health needs and build capacity of local resources.  Together, they support people throughout their crisis journey and improve health equity for historically marginalized and underserved communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Beacon will continue to deliver capabilities that will help address gaps in services and resources in our communities,” said Glenn MacFarlane, President, Beacon Health Options. “We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with KSCMHE on this initiative to ensure we are helping communities build better crisis systems based on a foundation of equity and capable of responding to the unique needs and experiences of each individual.”</p>

<p><strong>About Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p>The Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), an entity of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine, was jointly envisioned by the 16th U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, and former U.S. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy (D-RI). Building on their longstanding relationship and shared commitment to promoting mental health parity and health equity for people living with mental health and substance use disorders, the Center was made possible through a generous endowment from the Kennedy Forum, and matched by MSM’s endowment from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Authored by: First Lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Blake’s fourth-grade classroom at P.S. 121 in the Bronx was brimming with excited chatter on the first day of school when I stopped by with greetings.   Ms. Blake was handing out motivational quotes to students and guests to start the day on a positive note.  One quote read: “A beautiful day begins with a beautiful mindset” — a perfect sentiment for a time filled with both challenges and heartbreak, and compassion and kindness.</p>
<p>While our children do not understand every aspect of the pandemic, they feel it intensely.  Illness and death, isolation, lost jobs, and shuttered schools have taken a toll on everyone, including young people.  Emergency room visits for suicide attempts by those ages 12 to 17 increased 39.1 percent in the winter of 2021 compared to the winter of 2019, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm">according to the CDC</a>. It has been widely reported that anywhere from 1 to 3 million children were lost by schools nationwide during the pandemic. Those children did not show up for school, they did not log in online, they did not enroll.</p>
<p>As a mental health advocate, a mother, and the First Lady of New York City I view this once-in-a lifetime pandemic as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to increase attention to mental fitness and to improve access to mental health and substance misuse services. That is especially important for the youngest among us, who will spend a larger proportion of their lives dealing with the pandemic fallout.</p>
<p>I urge everyone to think big about baking mental fitness into every aspect of our children’s lives, in the same way we pay attention to their physical fitness. We can start with schools, in particular with school curriculums for social-emotional learning (SEL) <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casel.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FImproving-College-and-Career-Readiness-by-Incorporating-Social-and-Emotional-Learning_0.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7CFLee%40mentalhealth.nyc.gov%7Ce342089dc1dd416ca86408d95c23c59a%7C35c828166c56443bbaf68312163cadc1%7C0%7C0%7C637642130981065265%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=pT9HfkN7DtskfPohoXdAfZEKmcDGAGt51DHclbmmF84%3D&amp;reserved=0">a proven</a> educational approach used in schools nationwide, including New York City. Students learn to identify their emotions, manage feelings, build relationships, and resolve conflicts. It is a common-sense proposition that children cannot learn if they are anxious or traumatized.</p>
<p>Here in the nation’s largest school district, home to over 1 million students, we have rolled out a historic expansion of services for students and families. It is the robust menu needed, in some degree, in every single school in the country.  We are hiring new social workers, as well as psychologists and other support staff. Starting this fall, we will offer universal social-emotional screening to check in on how students are handling trauma, stress, and other challenges.  And if help is needed, every student will have access to a social worker or school-based mental health clinic. We will continue educating parents about mental health, too.  For many families, schools are at the center of their communities, a hub of support and information.</p>
<p>In early September, The JAMA Network Open <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783714?resultClick=1">featured a survey-study</a> of the association between school closures and child mental health during COVID-19. That study suggested that older and Black and Hispanic children, as well as those from low-income families who learned remotely, may experience greater mental health impairment than their whiter, younger, and higher-income counterparts.</p>
<p>But even before Covid-19, too many of our children were in trouble, and children from BIPOC communities are of special concern.</p>
<p>As of 2018, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/messages/2020/addressing-the-crisis-of-black-youth-suicide">suicide became the second leading cause of death</a> in Black children aged 10 to 14, and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2781104">Black children under 12</a> kill themselves at twice the rate of white children. Studies suggest that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-016-0445-8">Latina adolescents attempt suicide</a> at higher rates than Black or white adolescents.</p>
<p>When support for mental health challenges or substance misuse is sought, members of BIPOC communities often find themselves in a federally designated mental health desert –and/or they just can’t find someone culturally competent to talk to. I am a big advocate of community-based organizations and <a href="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/ccbhc-success-center/ccbhcta-overview/">Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics</a>, that provide mental health services as part of a broader health program.  We can also do more to train staff in community-based organizations to help identify those in need and provide low level support.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, the House this spring passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/721">Mental Health Services for Students Act</a>.  Let’s keep pushing legislators to support passage in the Senate. The act provides $130 million in competitive grants of up to $2 million each to expand the Project Advancing Wellness and Resilience Education program, which supports school-based mental health services.</p>
<p>Policy prescriptions and additional school supports only go so far, though. As schools and businesses re-open amid raging debates over mandates, masking, and vaccines, we should also think more deeply about how to improve our own mental fitness and the mental fitness of loved ones. How can we better support ourselves and those in our lives?  How has this pandemic clarified our values and priorities? How are we talking to the young people in our lives about Covid-19? The answers, like the questions, are as individual as we are. Now is the time to ask and to answer those questions and so many more.</p>
