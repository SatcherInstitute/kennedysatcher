<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month 2022</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>By: Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/hers), Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity advocates for the safety and well-being of all because access to safety and well-being should be seen as a basic civil right. Mental Health Awareness Month is when we call upon our mental health system to identify solutions so safety and wellbeing outcomes can improve. This month alone there have been three separate incidents of mass shootings in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-15/buffalo-shooting-that-killed-10-investigated-as-racially-motivated-violent-extremism">10 African-Americans murdered in Buffalo</a> in a racially motivated shooting crime at a grocery store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-15/multiple-people-shot-at-church-in-laguna-woods-o-c-sheriff-says">5 Asian-Americans critically injured</a> in a shooting crime at their church in California.</p>
<p>And this week, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/25/1101071658/what-we-know-about-uvalde-shooting">21 people, 19 young children and 2 adult teachers, in Uvalde, Texas</a>, murdered at their school by an 18 year old who purchased a rifle on his birthday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081">No other country in the world experiences mass incidents of violence and racism like we do here in the United States</a>. I am concerned that policies have historically seen the mental health system as the remedy to the complex trauma and rage that our society is burdened with due to exposure to such violence. It’s time we started treating violence and racism as public health and national security crises.</p>
<p>The news cycle has rekindled a memory of a case I was assigned some years ago. He was a middle-aged male of Puerto Rican descent, recently released from prison on parole. Within a few sessions, his psychiatrist and I became aware that he was pharma-seeking, as he kept “losing” his clonazepam supply and would appear to appointments under the influence. In response to being told he was not going to receive any more controlled medications, he stated he would bring an assault rifle to the clinic, and I was his target. I was not allowed to go to work for a week, while law enforcement discovered he had indeed illegally acquired weapons. He was quickly arrested and sent back to prison.</p>
<p>This story haunts me for many reasons. He had been in and out carceral facilities since he was 9 years old. I met him when he was 53. I’m haunted that someone could spend 44 years of their life knowing nothing but carceral settings. I am also haunted by the fact that we narrowly avoided a mass shooting at my clinic, and then went back to work and pretended like it never happened.</p>
<p>Too many of us have stories like this. We have been both numbed and conditioned to normalize these incidents, just as we have been numbed and conditioned to <a href="https://www.hurdle.health/2022-report">normalize mass incarceration and police violence.</a> Numbness and the impulse to normalize are signs of exposure to prolonged traumatic stress. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1101050970/2022-school-shootings-so-far">27 school shootings have taken place this year</a>, and there have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/15/1099008586/mass-shootings-us-2022-tally-number">199 mass shootings this year in total</a>. Only halfway into 2022, the US is averaging about 10 incidents a week. Where do we find the capacity to heal when the credible threat of trauma is constant? How do we as healers heal ourselves in lightning speed, so we can continue to be healers for our patients and students?</p>
<p>I remember in 2018, when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2018/03/us/student-walkout-cnnphotos/">children across the country walked out of school and marched to Capitol Hill</a>, demanding reforms to ensure there was school safety and stricter policies for accessing weapons after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-respond-shooting-parkland-florida-high-school-n848101">the horrific tragedy in Parkland, Florida.</a> I also remember the brown and black teen clients who came into therapy that night distraught because their public schools didn’t take their walkout seriously. One said, “Why don’t these powerful people care that there are guns in our schools every day? Do they think this is supposed to be normal for us?” I struggled to have words for those grieving kids that night. I hugged every single one of them.</p>
<p>May 25th is the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder. And in two years, despite all the momentum advocates have gained to address reform, we have been unsuccessful in being able to pass any legislation that addresses mass violence. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the House, and then collapsed last September, when negotiations from both parties in the Senate could not reach consensus. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/gun-laws-us-congress/index.html">HR 1446</a> is a bill that passed in the House that closes the “Charleston Loophole”, which would ensure gun sales cannot proceed without background checks being completed. But it is also stalled in the Senate.  That loophole is the reason why Dylan Roof was able to legally purchase a firearm and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/15/505723552/jury-finds-dylann-roof-guilty-in-s-c-church-shooting">kill nine people at a historically black church</a> in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.</p>
<p>Here’s what I implore this Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month: we must stop seeing solutions in a silo and recognize that they are systemic. At the Kennedy-Satcher Center, we pledge to ensure that every conversation held towards policy change, is backed with concrete, intersectional evidence that it is necessary. Children should not believe this is normal. Parents should never have to suffer a trauma like those in Texas are experiencing right now. Teachers and providers should not have to go back to work and pretend like these things don’t happen to them. We must change our approaches to policy reform because it can be life-saving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>On Being “Strengths-Based” and Having “Thick Skin”</strong></p>
<p>By Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/hers), Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The start of the year feels like a social media sprint through the first few annual “awareness months.” Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and before we know it, <a href="https://kennedysatcher.org/kscmhe-pulse/blog/mental-health-equity-is-health-equity/">Mental Health <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awareness</span> Equity Month</a>. As a leader in the equity space, for me, awareness months can be both motivational and overwhelming. Inequity is so intersectional in nature. It is persistently challenging to simplify scope. While it is widely known that oppression has influenced and caused deficiencies, I find that our historical records are not <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/strength-based-therapy">strengths-based</a> enough. A study conducted in<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/"> 2016</a> illuminated that many doctors exhibit racially biased and false beliefs that pain tolerance is biologically different between blacks and whites &#8212; quite simply, that black people have “thicker skin” than white people do. Evidence shows that in the United States, the foundations of these beliefs stemmed from the documented actions of pro-slavery physicians, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/racial-differences-doctors.html">Thomas Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3106.html">Samuel A. Cartwright</a>, the notorious source of the psychiatric diagnosis “drapetomania.” The way the American medical system has told women of color, specifically, to have “thick skin” perpetuates harmful narratives that influence their experiences accessing care. In my psychotherapy practice, my client base is predominantly female survivors of trauma. A humbling and important reminder of what it means to be strengths-based, I spend two nights a week striking a balance between giving my clients a space for their trauma narrative, while cultivating acknowledgment that they are powerful, capable, and brilliant. Closing Women’s History Month, I wonder how our narratives would shift if we approached evaluating, researching, and defining equity for mothers and daughters from a more strengths-based perspective?</p>
<p><em>The Mothers and Daughters of </em><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/attachment-theory/"><em>Understanding Attachment.</em></a> There are demonstrated research efforts to understand the impact of colonial and intergenerational trauma in American Indian/Alaska Native women. But only recently, have we begun to appropriately reckon with many, related traumatic realities they face – like, for example, the traumatic impact of forcible separation of children from their mothers due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6241300/">Compulsory Boarding School Policies</a>. While recent news has been rocked by discovery of frequent sexual abuse and unmarked graves of thousands of children who were forced to attend these schools, we must honor that we know about these stories only because of the bravery and resiliency of those who survived them, like <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/10/03/stories-of-life-in-indian-boarding-schools">Denise Lajimodiere (Ojibwe)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V6ewzenbk4">Yvonne Walker-Keshik (Odawa)</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Mothers and Daughters of Gynecological Wellness. </em>In 1934, the New York Academy of Medicine installed a statue in Central Park of Dr. J. Marion Sims. Dubbed by some as the “father of surgical gynecology,” the statue commemorated his scientific achievements in techniques to repair female reproductive organ dysfunction. Some years later, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563360/">Journal of Medical Ethics</a> exposed he developed these techniques by experimenting on enslaved black women, without the use of anesthesia. While we do not know the names of many of the victims, via Sims’ logs, we know the names of three: <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/02/recognizing-lucy-betsey-and-anarcha">Anarcha, Lucy and Betsey</a>. The records of the three women showed that they not only repeatedly healed each other but developed concepts of gynecological and surgical nursing that are still practiced today. In 2018, the New York City mayor <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/17/603163394/-father-of-gynecology-who-experimented-on-slaves-no-longer-on-pedestal-in-nyc">had the statue of Sims removed,</a> acknowledging that failing to honor the legacies of these women was a systemic injustice. Ironically in that same year, one of the greatest athletes of all time, Serena Williams, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018">was initially not believed by doctors</a>, when she could sense that her history with blood clots had resurfaced during her pregnancy. She harrowingly escaped maternal mortality while giving birth to her daughter Olympia and <a href="https://thesource.com/2018/05/29/serena-williams-grand-slam/">won the French Open</a> just eight months post-delivery.</p>
<p>Much evidence shows that women are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression/art-20047725">twice more likely</a> to be diagnosed with depression than men. Rates of depression and anxiety in Black, Latina, and American Indian/Alaska Native women, however, are higher than their white female counterparts. They are also less likely to seek care. It is arguable that BIPOC women are hesitant to seek outside help because they have been met with such historically traumatic and biased outcomes. And when one reflects on the stories outlined above, and countless others like them, it is harmful, and sometimes life-threatening, to purport that someone’s race or gender, or both, is the primary risk factor or cause for disease or mental illness. The inclusion of champions of healing and resilience in the way we define health and mental health is critical and paramount to advancing equity. We must find means to ensure that understanding barriers to access is complemented by the intentional evaluation, research, and creation of policies based on existing resiliency. For an equitable future, our records must never again doubt that mothers and daughters, especially those of color, are powerful, capable, and brilliant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Authored by: First Lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Blake’s fourth-grade classroom at P.S. 121 in the Bronx was brimming with excited chatter on the first day of school when I stopped by with greetings.   Ms. Blake was handing out motivational quotes to students and guests to start the day on a positive note.  One quote read: “A beautiful day begins with a beautiful mindset” — a perfect sentiment for a time filled with both challenges and heartbreak, and compassion and kindness.</p>
<p>While our children do not understand every aspect of the pandemic, they feel it intensely.  Illness and death, isolation, lost jobs, and shuttered schools have taken a toll on everyone, including young people.  Emergency room visits for suicide attempts by those ages 12 to 17 increased 39.1 percent in the winter of 2021 compared to the winter of 2019, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm">according to the CDC</a>. It has been widely reported that anywhere from 1 to 3 million children were lost by schools nationwide during the pandemic. Those children did not show up for school, they did not log in online, they did not enroll.</p>
<p>As a mental health advocate, a mother, and the First Lady of New York City I view this once-in-a lifetime pandemic as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to increase attention to mental fitness and to improve access to mental health and substance misuse services. That is especially important for the youngest among us, who will spend a larger proportion of their lives dealing with the pandemic fallout.</p>
<p>I urge everyone to think big about baking mental fitness into every aspect of our children’s lives, in the same way we pay attention to their physical fitness. We can start with schools, in particular with school curriculums for social-emotional learning (SEL) <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casel.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FImproving-College-and-Career-Readiness-by-Incorporating-Social-and-Emotional-Learning_0.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7CFLee%40mentalhealth.nyc.gov%7Ce342089dc1dd416ca86408d95c23c59a%7C35c828166c56443bbaf68312163cadc1%7C0%7C0%7C637642130981065265%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=pT9HfkN7DtskfPohoXdAfZEKmcDGAGt51DHclbmmF84%3D&amp;reserved=0">a proven</a> educational approach used in schools nationwide, including New York City. Students learn to identify their emotions, manage feelings, build relationships, and resolve conflicts. It is a common-sense proposition that children cannot learn if they are anxious or traumatized.</p>
<p>Here in the nation’s largest school district, home to over 1 million students, we have rolled out a historic expansion of services for students and families. It is the robust menu needed, in some degree, in every single school in the country.  We are hiring new social workers, as well as psychologists and other support staff. Starting this fall, we will offer universal social-emotional screening to check in on how students are handling trauma, stress, and other challenges.  And if help is needed, every student will have access to a social worker or school-based mental health clinic. We will continue educating parents about mental health, too.  For many families, schools are at the center of their communities, a hub of support and information.</p>
<p>In early September, The JAMA Network Open <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783714?resultClick=1">featured a survey-study</a> of the association between school closures and child mental health during COVID-19. That study suggested that older and Black and Hispanic children, as well as those from low-income families who learned remotely, may experience greater mental health impairment than their whiter, younger, and higher-income counterparts.</p>
<p>But even before Covid-19, too many of our children were in trouble, and children from BIPOC communities are of special concern.</p>
<p>As of 2018, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/messages/2020/addressing-the-crisis-of-black-youth-suicide">suicide became the second leading cause of death</a> in Black children aged 10 to 14, and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2781104">Black children under 12</a> kill themselves at twice the rate of white children. Studies suggest that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-016-0445-8">Latina adolescents attempt suicide</a> at higher rates than Black or white adolescents.</p>
<p>When support for mental health challenges or substance misuse is sought, members of BIPOC communities often find themselves in a federally designated mental health desert –and/or they just can’t find someone culturally competent to talk to. I am a big advocate of community-based organizations and <a href="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/ccbhc-success-center/ccbhcta-overview/">Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics</a>, that provide mental health services as part of a broader health program.  We can also do more to train staff in community-based organizations to help identify those in need and provide low level support.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, the House this spring passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/721">Mental Health Services for Students Act</a>.  Let’s keep pushing legislators to support passage in the Senate. The act provides $130 million in competitive grants of up to $2 million each to expand the Project Advancing Wellness and Resilience Education program, which supports school-based mental health services.</p>
<p>Policy prescriptions and additional school supports only go so far, though. As schools and businesses re-open amid raging debates over mandates, masking, and vaccines, we should also think more deeply about how to improve our own mental fitness and the mental fitness of loved ones. How can we better support ourselves and those in our lives?  How has this pandemic clarified our values and priorities? How are we talking to the young people in our lives about Covid-19? The answers, like the questions, are as individual as we are. Now is the time to ask and to answer those questions and so many more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“An Entire Nation Traumatized”</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/hers), Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p>In between meetings and planning for the inaugural <a href="https://kennedysatcher.org/event/mental-health-equity-is-health-equity-day-1/#details">Mental Health Equity Speaker Symposium</a>, I admit that I have found myself distracted at times in the past couple of weeks, unable to ignore the images of children and families trying to escape Afghanistan. The United States Government announced it was ending its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/19/1028472005/afghanistan-conflict-timeline">20 year occupation</a> of the country, and the world watched in horror as the Taliban took over the Afghani government. Men dropping to their deaths from ascending planes, and babies being handed to US soldiers over wire fences. I recall my experiences working with refugee families and children, many who told me their own stories of making the tumultuous journey across the US border in hopes for a safer life. Their faces are imprinted in my memory, as they pursued treatment with me for Acute or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). As I sat down to write this month’s blog, I realized that the levels of trauma depicted so regularly in the news are not only record-breaking, but their vicarious effects on us as a society are widespread and complex.</p>
<p>The diagnostic criteria for PTSD requires exposure to a traumatic event that is either direct OR indirect. Historically, <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ptsd/what-is-ptsd">PTSD diagnoses have been most commonly given</a> to military veterans, survivors of violence or natural disaster, recently diagnosed medical patients, and people of color. Shaken by isolation and limited travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans have been forced to view repeated images of violence, distress and disaster in the news, in our efforts to remain informed about how the rest of the world is faring compared to us. An attempt to summarize just how much trauma the United States has endured over the last year is breathtaking.</p>
<p>The obvious trauma is national witness to the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days">637,000 deaths (and counting)</a> due to COVID-19. In the midst of this, the US also saw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/23/2020-shootings/">the largest surge in gun violence</a> recorded since 1960, with nearly 20,000 gun violence deaths and an additional 24,000 gun-related deaths due to suicide in 2020. Hate crimes have been steadily increasing since 2014, and the FBI recently reported <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2019-hate-crime-statistics">twice as many hate-related incidents</a> in 2019 than the year prior. While 2020 reports show a 7% decrease in hate crimes overall, there was a <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/sites/default/files/FACT%20SHEET-%20Anti-Asian%20Hate%202020%203.2.21.pdf">150% increase</a> in violence against Americans of Asian-descent. The televised trial for George Floyd’s murder included a graphic replay of the video of his death, as the trend of fatal police shooting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/">is rising</a>. 523 civilians were shot by police in the first six months of 2021, 104 of whom were black. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/05/health/child-abuse-hotline-study-wellness/index.html">Child abuse </a>and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2024046">domestic violence</a> hotline calls surged at an alarming rate in 2020, likely due to heightened family distress during lockdown. And then there is the climate-related trauma. Climate scientists unanimously agree that <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2020-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-historical">2020 was record-breaking for the U.S.</a> with regard to the number of named tropical storms, wildfires, rain and flooding events, and episodes of extreme heat – 22 natural disasters amassing over 95 billion US dollars spent on damages. The month’s #KSCMHEPulse could be solely devoted to listing how many traumatic incidents qualify an American to receive a trauma-related disorder diagnosis due to direct or indirect exposure.</p>
<p>Lately, my discussions with other thought leaders bring us to a difficult dilemma with the overwhelming burden that trauma currently has on our society and what we can truly do to rectify it. Over the years, the healthcare system has grown increasingly comfortable with implementing trauma-informed approaches for high-risk and vulnerable populations. But revisiting the realities outlined in the above paragraph, we are now at risk of failing to meet trauma-informed treatment standards for our entire country’s population. The other truth about the above realities is that they have costed the United States billions of dollars in damage and recovery needs. If it is known that trauma-informed psychotherapy <a href="https://gucchdtacenter.georgetown.edu/TraumaInformedCare/IssueBrief5_PublicHealthApproach.pdf">benefits the economy</a>, then it could be said that the implementation of wrap-around trauma-informed services could only multiply that benefit. <a href="https://kennedysatcher.org/blog/mental-health-equity-is-health-equity/">If mental health equity is health equity</a>, then trauma-informed care can no longer be seen as a purely a psychological intervention. One of the easiest things we can reframe to alleviate this burden is to acknowledge that the communities we currently live in are all traumatized.  Efforts should be geared towards applying a trauma-informed policy lens to all areas that Americans interface with, such as medicine, education, criminal justice, and employment. Often in therapy, the most powerful first step towards progress is when a clinician can tell a trauma survivor, “I believe you.” Imagine the impact we could have if we told whole communities, “We believe you.” To me, that’s a powerful first step towards sustainable, systemic recovery for an entire nation that is traumatized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“Saving the Lives of the Invisible”</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/her/hers) – Director, Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p>Since George Floyd’s murder, our media cycle has forced the behavioral health equity movement to be wrought with conflicting points of urgency, as we reckon with the field’s own contribution to oppression in practice. According to the Harvard Political Review, people with mental illness are more than 4.5 times more likely to be arrested than the general population. The Treatment Advocacy Center found that people with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter. This population accounts for almost 50% of the people who are fatally shot by police. And yet, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has now spent a full year stalled in the Senate. This stall validates a long-standing discomfort our system has in acknowledging the historical intersection between mental illness, oppression, and the criminal justice system. It compels me to focus my dissection of policies on whether they are upholding one’s civil right to live.</p>
<p>If asked, I would not be able to count how many patients, primarily patients of color, I have seen the system fail. Patients who cycle in and out of mental institutions, prisons, and homelessness. Patients who die of suicide, addiction, violence, or face long-term sentences for crimes commit during a psychiatric crisis. I often ask myself: how did we get here? If we look at policies that led to the creation of asylums in the early 19th century, the zeal for their expansion in mental health care was based in the idea that treatment plans could only work if patients and staff shared common values and culture. A deeper look, however, shows us that these markers for success could not be sustained through the influx of immigration and urban immigrant poverty due to industrialization, the sociopolitical aftermath of abolitionism, and the advent of laws geared toward the erasure of native heritage. The inevitable increase in diagnoses of “insanity” amongst free black people, American Indian/Alaska Natives, and immigrants led to overpopulation of these groups in asylums and ultimately, penitentiaries. That reality remains for these groups today.</p>
<p>Our news cycle is currently reminding us of the horrific consequences of “compulsory attendance” laws. Passed in 1891 in the US and Canada, these laws enabled federal law enforcement to forcibly take native children from their reservations, under the justification that they were being rescued from poverty. Children were placed at boarding schools aimed at changing legal identification and physical appearance, teaching “life skills” that undid generational native traditions and forcing assimilation into western lifestyles. ABC News reported recently that the unmarked graves of almost 1000 (and counting) native people, mainly children, have been found at former boarding school sites that were formed by these attendance laws.</p>
<p>1000 unmarked graves and counting.</p>
<p>I am pleased to see the urgency to re-examine our emergency response protocols and prioritize the prevention of fatal law enforcement outcomes. Modeled after the CAHOOTS program in Eugene, Oregon, many cities are adopting mental health emergency response systems that remove police presence and dispatch a joint response between EMS and social workers, when someone is in psychiatric crisis and not violent. Recent evaluations of these programs are showing that they are indeed reducing fatality and increasing access to care. This comes in conjunction with the forecasted 2022 roll-out of 988, a national mental health emergency number that will replace the suicide prevention hotline. As the implementation plan of 988 is finalized, we have a critical opportunity to demand thoughtful emergency response and give visibility to communities that have not been given this privilege historically. This should include a look at things like rural access to mental healthcare, and the location of some native reservations that are so remote they are only accessible via helicopter. As we consider culturally attuned care, our policies have an opportunity to go beyond just acknowledging the effects of institutional oppression, by embarking on attention to detail that prioritizes the saving of human life.</p>
<p>While we continue to say the names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, we must also say the names of lesser-known victims. Like Ricardo Muñoz, aged 27, living with unstable paranoid schizophrenia, killed by police in 2020 in Lancaster, PA. Six weeks earlier, Walter Wallace, Jr. a black man having a psychotic episode, killed by police in Philadelphia. In 2017, Paul Castaway, a member of the Sicangu Lakota tribe, living with mental illness and addiction, killed by police in Colorado. We must give voice to those human lives that have been historically invisible to federal policies and demand that these policies rectify past systemic traumas. The momentum is there; it is on us to capitalize on it. Behavioral health equity cannot just address standards for treatment and care, it must also promote the equitable standards we uphold to keep all people alive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>#CelebrateImmigrants</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/her/hers) – Director, Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p>Washington Heights, New York took the big screen by storm this month, as Lin-Manuel Miranda’s spectacular movie production of In the Heights sparks dialogue across the globe about representation and inclusivity in film. In the Heights is Miranda’s homage to a culturally rich, beautiful, and diverse pocket of uptown Manhattan, where 70% of the population is Spanish-speaking. It is a particular victory in the film equity movement for Latinx people. While the movie is being celebrated for its on-location shoots and having a majority Caribbean and Latinx cast, the issue of colorism is being highlighted by some who feel Afro-Latinx people were deprived of an opportunity to shine as the leads. In my own role in the mental health equity movement, it is always interesting to see how the legacies of colonialism, systemic oppression, and racism rear their heads, as we see increasing demands for cultural inclusivity trend in today’s climate.</p>
<p>For years, I lived in and served upper Manhattan as a full-time bilingual (Spanish-English) child and family psychotherapist. Washington Heights is designated by HRSA as a medically underserved community, which means that it has too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty, and a high elderly population. The shortage of mental health services is exponential in medically underserved communities, speaking to the historically low priority that funding for mental health services receives overall. The outpatient, Article 31 clinic I worked in was my first job out of graduate training. A first-generation Indian-American myself, I was a brown-skinned social worker, who happened to speak Spanish. I was eager to see how my education could be translated to a high needs community that reflected an immigrant culture that was similar in many ways to mine growing up in Chicago. What I was not prepared for was that the experience challenged so many things I had been trained to believe were integral to effective care. The concepts of confidentiality, self-disclosure, trust building, and language choice were tested because I realized quickly that western medical ideals surrounding treatment boundaries were not entirely conducive to an environment where we were treating an entire neighborhood in one clinic space. For me, the experience redefined my belief in what an affirming, inclusive therapeutic environment actually is. It redefined the language I used to see a patient go from crisis to wellness.</p>
<p>Many immigrants come from places where mental health services barely exist. Stigma around mental illness can permeate through existing norms in home country culture and persist through survival mechanisms that are activated during the assimilation process once here in the US. New York state healthcare laws afford leeway to allow for undocumented and documented patients alike to receive care. In mental health, that translates to Medicaid and private insurance coverage for documented immigrants and an affordable sliding scale fee for those who are undocumented. Mental health clinicians are trained to use language to inform patients on their treatment course, outcomes, and progress. Often, however, our field misses the mark in acknowledging how many cultural dimensions language carries for our work — the language our patients feel comfortable with, the inflection in our tone, and the physical space in which we communicate.</p>
<p>Our clinic waiting room was a true reflection of the community. Neighbors, friends and church-goers could convene and converse in Spanish about family updates and their latest travels home, while also safely saying out loud, “Estoy esperando a mi terapeuta,” – I am waiting for my therapist. That environment alone was an exercise in stigma reduction – a true depiction of normalizing mental illness. The waiting room was a vibrant and emotionally safe gateway, leading to a space behind the office door where a kid could confidentially tell his therapist about involvement in neighborhood gang activity or fears about coming out as gay to Catholic parents. And yet, it being the only clinic in the community, admission wait times for services were often months on end after intake, coupled with frequent turn over of staff and inability to meet the demand for patients of higher risk.</p>
<p>What the debate about In the Heights has brought up for me is that I can feel both things. I can appreciate affirming, inclusive spaces in the mental health field like my old clinic, and I can challenge myself to think about how our therapeutic norms themselves may be an oppressive barrier to engaging a population that is already so isolated. From that purview, I choose to #CelebrateImmigrants who achieve triumph in communities like Washington Heights where even though the clinic space is not “traditional,” mental wellness has become a part of entire community’s everyday experience. Ironic, because that is exactly what our traditional treatment goals dictate should be the desired outcome for a patient in our care.</p>

<p>In his latest op-ed, Patrick Kennedy discusses the implications of this act and how our country has reached a tipping point in who should attend to these crises, why we must continue to fight to establish fair mental health policies, and how we must respond in a manner that is not only just, but also actionable and equitable.</p>
<p>“Less obvious, but even more insidious, is the fact that the response to people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis is often law enforcement. Police were never meant — or adequately trained — to deal with psychiatric crises. The results are both traumatizing and, frequently, tragic. According to the Treatment Advocacy Center, people with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed by police. In 2017, an average of 10 percent of law enforcement agencies’ total budgets and 21 percent of staff time were spent responding to and transporting persons with mental illness. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. A 2015 analysis found that the 10 largest police departments in the country paid out almost a quarter of a billion dollars the previous year in settlements and judgements (up nearly 50 percent from four years earlier). Many of these settlements were related to wrongful-death lawsuits of people in a mental health crisis.” – Patrick Kennedy</p>

<p><strong>“Mental Health Awareness Equity Month”</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH (she/her/hers) – Director, Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</strong></p>
<p>One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, it is again Mental Health Awareness Month. This pandemic has exposed systemic fractures in healthcare, where already disenfranchised populations now face an unstable resource base to meet their needs. National attention to urgent issues like police brutality and anti-Asian rhetoric have generated an era where social justice is a prioritized talking point for leaders across disciplines. “Equity” has become a buzz word — a word that carries power, if approached thoughtfully and consciously. While I may be the new Director of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), I will always consider myself a clinician first. We are healers of the human experience. We carry our patients through confronting adversity, restoring agency, and achieving survivorship – a unique responsibility that requires us to ensure our own wellness is sustained. It is undeniable that right now practitioners and patients are experiencing an extreme collective trauma simultaneously, and we are deep in a complicated mental health crisis. This month, I am compelled to think about what we advocate for and how we message it.</p>
<p>Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental illness was increasing. Now, we are seeing these figures skyrocket. According to the Mental Health America, individuals living with schizophrenia are ten times more likely to contract the virus, and three times more likely to die from it. Youth mental health has worsened, illuminating the system’s inability to support children during this period of remote learning. A recent CDC study showed that due to implications associated with COVID-19, respondents reported increase in symptoms of anxiety or depression, increase in substance use, heightened stress-response, and some reported having serious thoughts of suicide in the past 30 days. The referenced rates are nearly double what the field would have expected before the pandemic. The National Institute for Mental Health estimates that there are more people of Asian, Black, Latinx, and Native descent seeking culturally-sensitive mental health resources than ever before — a reflection of how historic racial and ethnic injustice is now virally on display through media.</p>
<p>I was the Director of an Assertive Community Treatment team in New York City during COVID-19. My unit was responsible for providing intensive mobile psychiatric services to individuals with serious mental illness. Mental health resources were slashed to account for the waves of COVID-19 cases. Psychiatry services were classified like elective surgeries, and psychiatric units were reduced in bed capacity to create space for COVID overflow. We saw an increase in psychiatric decompensation, criminal arrest, and homelessness. We sadly lost many patients living with co-morbid issues, such as substance use or chronic illness, because the system could not meet multiple needs at once. Mental health clinicians, like all healthcare providers, were not trained to work in such unfamiliar conditions or combat this much systemic duress. This crisis forced our system to become cross-sectional for the first time, and a steep learning curve in the field has exposed trickle-down consequences of the economic burden of the pandemic and the way consumers access mental healthcare.</p>
<p>KSCMHE seizes this opportunity to re-think our own community engagement and commit to developing a new vision for what equitable behavioral health care truly means in a post-COVID world. Deficiencies in mental health data are a result of poor reporting amongst patients and a long-standing lack of innovation in how information is accessed. We must acknowledge the persistent mistrust that historically marginalized people have in our healthcare system, and ensure that data collection and programming are inclusive, affirming, and participatory. Our field must leverage the political and social momentum during the COVID-19 era by prioritizing input from patients and interdisciplinary providers on the front-line. We must demand that our environments and policies adopt a trauma-informed approach, a treatment lens which assumes that an individual is more than likely to have a history of trauma, and advocate that it be applied to all facets of integrated healthcare. Our messaging must recognize a history of oppression in our field itself, with specific attention to the evolution of mental health diagnosis and mental hygiene law. In my own role, I aim to be cross-cutting in how my center closely investigates systems like criminal justice, education, housing, child welfare, among others — environments where many historically traumatized groups, and many of my own patients, have received a mental health diagnosis for the first time.</p>
<p>As the problem has evolved, our messaging needs to as well. Mental health equity is health equity. When the stakes are so high, “awareness” is no longer a strong enough message. I ask you to join me in re-naming it “Mental Health Equity Month.” The time is now to repair and build the foundation for an equitable mental health system that can carry entire populations through sustained recovery during periods of crisis and beyond.</p>
