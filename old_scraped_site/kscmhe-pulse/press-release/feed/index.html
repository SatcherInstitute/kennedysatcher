<p><strong>New Initiative to Define Policy Recommendations for Embedding Equity into 988</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atlanta, GA – May 11, 2022- Today, the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), an entity of the Satcher Health Leadership at Morehouse School of Medicine, announces a new initiative in partnership with Beacon Health Options (Beacon): <em>Embedding Equity into 988: Imagining a New Normal for Crisis Response. </em>This research and policy initiative will imagine equitable crisis response for the future of behavioral health service delivery ahead of the July 2022 launch of 988, a national crisis line that will serve as a “911” for psychiatric emergencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have been witness to a 911 call going badly for someone in crisis. It is the type of mental image that stays with you forever in this line of work,” said KSCMHE Director and practicing clinician, Madhuri Jha, LSCW, MPH, who is also spearheading this initiative. “Our current psychiatric emergency response system fails to adequately meet the needs of our most vulnerable. For Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and other historically marginalized communities, 988 is an opportunity to ensure our system is saving and treating lives the way all humans deserve to be treated. From an evidence-based perspective, we will thoughtfully craft concrete and culturally responsive recommendations and evaluation measures to ensure that this significant moment in history advances equity the way it truly has the potential to do,” emphasized Jha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Embedding Equity into 988</em> will conduct a rapid academic review and survey assessment to inform a policy brief that will outline a series of detailed recommendations for effective and equitable administration of 988. This policy brief will be complemented with a virtual half-day leadership summit on June 21, 2022, where leaders in behavioral healthcare will discuss the equitable roll-out of 988 with the objective of defining strategies to address the unmet needs in crisis response, especially for historically marginalized people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. David Satcher, former 16th U.S. Surgeon General and founder of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute shared, “Over the years, I have seen people of color dismissed and not get the care they need or deserved. Our crisis and emergency response system simply does not know how to respond to diverse needs or are just negligent at times. This partnership and concentrated effort to make 988 equitable is bringing to light what is needed to respond and support the needs of all in a way that works. The goal for embedding equitable response structures into 988 is to truly provide our community members with the support they need versus doing more harm. This initiative and partnership aims to do just that.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Actualizing equitable mental health service delivery is long overdue in our nation,” stated former U.S. Rep. and co-founder of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity, Patrick J. Kennedy. “Although having a dedicated crisis line for mental health emergencies is a major step in the right direction, ensuring we can provide the appropriate services to everyone, as part of its roll out, will be critical to its long-term success. I am grateful to Beacon Health Options for partnering with us to shine a spotlight on this issue.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This collaboration and initiative is a monumental opportunity for the advancement towards equitable healthcare for our nation. Structural barriers to equitable healthcare and the resulting inequities from these barriers, while daunting, are not permanent,” said, Satcher Health Leadership Institute’s Executive Director, Daniel Dawes, J.D.  “The work we are doing now to embed equity into the upcoming 988 crisis line is a leap towards dissolving these politically-determined barriers and the start to a more permanent, equitable, and holistic healthcare system.  I am thrilled at the opportunity for the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Beacon Health Options to join forces in this important work.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the nation moves closer to the national launch of 988, Beacon has been working closely with states to elevate the level of care they are able to provide through responsive crisis programs. Beacon’s team of experts include individuals with clinical and lived experience to support people in crisis in communities across the country, working collaboratively to identify and address public health needs and build capacity of local resources.  Together, they support people throughout their crisis journey and improve health equity for historically marginalized and underserved communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Beacon will continue to deliver capabilities that will help address gaps in services and resources in our communities,” said Glenn MacFarlane, President, Beacon Health Options. “We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with KSCMHE on this initiative to ensure we are helping communities build better crisis systems based on a foundation of equity and capable of responding to the unique needs and experiences of each individual.”</p>

<p><strong>Atlanta, GA – December 17, 2021—</strong> Today, the Satcher Health Leadership Institute’s <a href="https://kennedysatcher.org/">Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity</a> (KSCMHE) at Morehouse School of Medicine, with support from the Wellpath Cares Foundation, announces a five episode webinar roundtable series titled, “Criminal Justice and Equity: Bridging the Gaps”.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by KSCMHE Director and practicing clinician, Madhuri Jha, LSCW, MPH, the series, which begins on January 18, aims to address the landscape of inequities that affect justice-involved individuals. Jha’s extensive background working with vulnerable and high-risk communities drives her unique approach to  the content of each webinar, through a lens of mental health equity and policy.</p>
<p>“As a mobile behavioral health unit director in New York City, I have seen first hand how invisible and neglected this population is by our healthcare system, and yet how much potential there is to reduce recidivism if approached thoughtfully,” said Madhuri Jha. “These conversations will be important to illuminating that potential, especially now, as our society confronts the idea of justice head on.”</p>
<p>Each webinar session will feature expert panelists sharing perspectives on topics including policy implementation and data, behavioral health equity and incarceration, trauma-informed systems for justice-involved populations, re-entry programs and reducing recidivism, and housing access and environmental support systems.</p>
<p>“This is a pivotal time in American history,” said former U.S. Rep. and founder of The Kennedy Forum, Patrick J. Kennedy. “We have a chance to reject the status quo and re-think critical systems in our country that have oppressed those with mental health and addiction challenges for far too long. It’s time to right the wrongs of the past and finally address brain health as essential health.”</p>
<p>“We must also acknowledge that, if not for untreated mental illness, many of our incarcerated persons would not be incarcerated in the first place. This means that society – at – large, as well as the mentally ill stand to benefit from a more aggressive and informed program of diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems.” said Dr. David Satcher, former 16th U.S. Surgeon General and founder of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute. “This is especially critical for the African American males who make up such a large proportion of our incarcerated population. We can do better; we must do better.”</p>
<p>Further adding to the stigma surrounding mental health care, the Treatment Advocacy Center reports that overall, roughly 20% of inmates in jails and 15% of inmates in state prisons are estimated to have a serious mental illness (2016). KSCMHE acknowledges that the civil rights movement shed light on the blurred line between criminal legal systems and mental health institutions for people of color and with this program hopes to create a space for thoughtful discussions that can remedy the frequent criminalization of mental illness.</p>
<p>“As the leading provider of healthcare services to the justice involved community, Wellpath cares for some of our nation’s most vulnerable patients in challenging clinical environments.  Our goal is to help them improve their health and quality of life,” said Dr. Thomas Pangburn, FACEP, Chief Clinical Officer of Wellpath, the Wellpath Cares Foundation’s affiliate and major sponsor.  “Wellpath’s vision includes the transformation of our healthcare system to one of greater equity, by delivering hope and healing through public health partnerships.  We are proud that the Wellpath Cares Foundation supports organizations like the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE) at Morehouse School of Medicine.”</p>
<p>KSCMHE will kick off this programming with Session 1: “Policy Implementation and Data Use” on Tuesday January 18, 2022 11:00AM – 12:30PM EST via Zoom. Registration is free and participants can sign up in advance by visiting: <a href="https://bit.ly/3IMc5Ud">https://bit.ly/3IMc5Ud</a>.</p>

<p>Moderated by Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH, Director of KSCMHE, the first session will feature welcome remarks from founder of KSCMHE, the Honorable Patrick J. Kennedy, Executive Director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Author of “The Political Determinants of Health”, Daniel E.
