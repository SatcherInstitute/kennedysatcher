Kennedy (D-RI), who shared a unique vision and passion for mental health parity and equity. As the Director for KSCMHE, it is my honor to welcome you to our Center where you can learn about joining our movement to make the mental and behavioral health system more equitable.<\/p>\n<p>At KSCMHE we are committed to the development of innovative, intersectional research, and programming specifically targeted at improving mental health outcomes for the healthcare system&#8217;s most vulnerable. The COVID-19 crisis has amplified the urgency of addressing fractures in our system, as we anticipate the mental health impact of the pandemic will be unprecedented. We aim to promote that mental health equity is critical to overall health equity, and as a leader in the movement, I call on our community partners and collaborators to join us in this challenge to advocate for the creation of policies, environments, and networks that are inclusive, just, and transformative.<\/p>\n<p>In my years as a clinician, I have seen firsthand the power of sustained recovery and the determination it takes to get there. Through meaningful partnership, I do believe we can achieve mental health equity for all.<\/p>\nWith pride and in solidarity,<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/kennedysatcher.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Signature.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><br \/>\n&#8211; Madhuri Jha\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the\u00a0Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity\u00a0(KSCMHE)!
