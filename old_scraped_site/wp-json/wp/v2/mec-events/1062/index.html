The esteemed panelists, while leaders and experts in their field, also share a close and personal connection to equity work. The speakers engage in hour-long conversations and discuss how behavioral health inequities affect justice involved individuals.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Session 5: Housing Access and Environmental Support Systems<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>May 17, 2022, from 11 am \u2013 12:30 p.m. EST via Zoom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>KSCMHE Director Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH began the final roundtable session for this series with welcome remarks and introducing the topic for the discussion: Housing Access and Environmental Support Systems. \u00a0Former Congressman and KSCMHE co-founder, Patrick J. Kennedy, shared a welcome and introductory message where he shared his appreciation for all those who have supported this series. He highlighted the importance and value of this roundtable series as conversations that are needed because we cannot continue to be the leading nation in incarcerating the most per capita. Kennedy concluded his remarks with sharing his appreciation for all the panelists and everyone that has supported in planning and hosting these roundtables.<\/p>\n<p>The audience members then listened into the panel discussing housing access and environmental support systems for justice-involved populations. The panel featured the following experts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schroeder Stribling, MSW, President and CEO of Mental Health America<\/li>\n<li>Jason Bryant, Director of Programs of CROP Organization<\/li>\n<li>Sarah Y. Vinson, MD, Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at Morehouse School of Medicine<\/li>\n<li>Alexis Rosales, MPA, Executive Director of Business Development of Gateway Foundation, Inc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jason Bryant started the conversation with sharing why access to housing and support systems are important for someone transitioning into re-entry based on his own lived experiences. From the start, Jason affirmed, \u201cIt is almost impossible to get anything done without a roof over your head.\u201d He shared that out of the thousands he met while incarcerated, he had a \u201csoft landing\u201d compared to the rest because he had support systems throughout his sentence and a home to come back to. With the amount of stigma associated with being incarcerated and without housing and support, re-entry becomes extremely challenging. Dr. Sarah Vinson, a psychiatrist at Morehouse School of Medicine, supported Bryant\u2019s comments sharing it is all about safety and security, and without a safe and stable place of housing, it is often difficult to be successful.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder Stribling joined the conversation with sharing her experience at N Street Village where her work focused on the intersection between housing and mental health. She shared her work included supporting many women who were displaced upon leaving the justice-system. She recognized that upon existing the justice system, housing and homelessness is just one of the challenges faced. They also need support with trauma and addictions. Majority of those that needed support were African American\/Black and\/or identified as LGBTQ+. Dr. Vinson focused on how families are impacted &#8211; as many that get sentenced to prison are often parents themselves. She recognized that trauma that is endured by the whole family and often being reunited with children is not considered upon re-entry. She recognized how trauma is so prominent within the justice-system but is often unrecognized and unreported or undiagnosed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alexis Rosales professionally worked for Indiana state\u2019s correctional facilities focusing on re-entry and as a substance use counselor prior to joining the Gateway Foundation. Through her work in Indiana and now the Gateway Foundation, she has focused providing a holistic approach that also recognizes the intersection between substance use and the justice-involved population. Rosales shared from her work experience; housing unfortunately is the area with the least amount of progress. She specifically focused on the stigma associated with the justice-involved population and difficulty acclimating to the community. She called out that many community members may want to support, but they do not want justice-involved individuals to be a part of their neighborhoods, near their child\u2019s schools. They want to, \u201csupport from a distance.\u201d Because of this desire to \u201csupport from a distance\u201d the funding and infrastructure needed is \u201cjust not there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Stribling emphasized the lack of support and policies that allow access to adequate housing by identifying the barriers present. The evidence that recognizes the importance of housing is available, and we know what the solution is. However, the question lingers of, \u201cHow and where do we ensure we have the right political incentives lined up, and we need the cooperation of lots of different partners. I think it is a complex problem because we need the cooperation of various sectors. We need the affordable housing authority, local community-based clinics, policy and practice lined up, so it is a complex problem, but the solutions are pretty simple.\u201d Stribling also highlighted this is a complex problem that also needs to be supported by the public. She shared, \u201cStigma is so deep\u2026it makes it harder for us to have a compassionate policy perspective developed that will address the problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Empowered by Stribling\u2019s comments, Bryant shared it is \u201cpervasive\u201d how we think about the justice-involved population. He shared it does not matter \u201cwhat side of the aisle\u201d anyone is on, the solution and goal should be to want everyone that comes home (from prison) to succeed. He continued to state if we (as a society) can agree to want them to succeed, then we can provide the support that is needed. Rosales agreed and recognized in other countries it is a community effort \u2013 \u201cWhat can we do to wrap around this individual to help them succeed?\u201d And the mindset here within the United States is, \u201cThis person needs to prove themselves. They need to prove they can be resourceful. They need to prove they can be a contributing member of this society.\u201d Rosales also recognized that these messages and stigmas already make re-entry difficult, and our policies also support these stigmas. Using a real case example, Rosales called out the unspoken \u201casterisk\u201d that is attached to every justice-involved individual that is trying to re-enter society. That asterisk limits them from moving forward and living even years and even decades after being released. Moderator Madhuri Jha, LCSW, MPH, identified Rosales comments as the intersectionality with housing discrimination, and the asterisk becomes more of a family, community, and wellness asterisk.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jha transitioned the group\u2019s discussion to then focus on the impact and use of data when addressing the challenges of housing and environmental support systems available for the marginalized populations. Stribling recognized there unfortunately is not enough data to address the problems. The lack of data itself is \u201cindicative to the stigma and discrimination.\u201d There is great vulnerability for certain populations that we do not capture in data. Stribling also identified the fine line that individuals facing homelessness face with becoming justice-involved. 48 states have some law that conflicts legal ways for an individual to live if they are homeless, for example camping. These limitations make it harder for individuals and starts a cycle between incarceration and homelessness. Continuing to highlight the gaps present within data, Bryant added the importance of capturing quantitative and qualitative data. He questions, \u201cWhere is the data that captures the experience\u201d of the justice-involved population, \u201cHow are we as a society justifying the \u2018othering\u2019 that is happening? When did we as society decide the purpose of prison is to punish versus to rehabilitate our fellow humans?\u201d Bryant emphasized the value of qualitative data because that is the data that captures the experience that we are saying is okay \u201cto treat our fellow citizens, our fellow human beings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jha recognized the work of equity is also focused on measuring the resiliency of marginalized communities, but, unfortunately, more often than not we measure the problems within marginalized communities rather than what is going well. Dr. Vinson identified that resiliency often puts the burden on the individual who is \u201creceiving the ill treatment rather than addressing the root cause.\u201d She shared the valuable of example of burnout among those working in justice-involved setting, such as correctional officers. She shared the idea of \u201cis it burnout or is it arson\u201d that was shared with her by a mentor to help us evaluate when is there lack of compassion and that someone may be burnt out, versus when there are systemic issues that do not allow individuals working with the justice-involved to have \u201cmore compassion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The panelists shared key policies and legislative changes they believe are important to ensure the justice involved population is provided with the support needed. The group identified key policies including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>more holistic release plans that provide them with the foundational resources needed<\/li>\n<li>the need for Medicare to provide more financial support to providers so that the justice-involved have ask to more healthcare resources<\/li>\n<li>the multiple \u201cbanning the box\u201d initiatives<\/li>\n<li>meeting the individuals where they are using more resourceful and strengths-based methods (i.e. technology)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Connecting all the valuable comments being shared by the panelists, Jha brought the groups ideas together to then explore what\u2019s missing &#8211; \u201cwho needs a seat at the table\u201d that currently does not have one. Dr. Vinson started with sharing those with more proximity need to be invited into the conversation. She went further than saying, just having a seat at the table is not enough. Individuals with experience need to have a voice at the table as well. She exclaimed, \u201cWe need more!\u201d and there cannot only be one person in the room that comes with the diverse or lived experience\/background. Stribling echoed Dr. Vinson\u2019s sentiments with stating individuals with lived experience need to be \u201cat the table\u201d. She said, \u201cHow else are we going to know what the real circumstances are, what the real needs are, what the real effect of the carceral system has been in their lives or the lives of their family members? So, we need people with lived experience to lead the way and we need to be willing to follow.\u201d Rosales shared we need the visionaries, and we need the realistic individuals that have a sense of how something will and can be executed on the ground as well \u2013 the active voices that do this work on a regular basis that can identify the barriers and also find solutions to work around or with those barriers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Through an extremely powerful, honest and respectful dialogue, the panelist all left the conversation with sharing key messages for the audience to walk away with.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Through Stribling\u2019s work with N Street Village, she shared key take aways which included: specifically, transgender and nonbinary women are a population vulnerable to severe adversity and neglect in prison, and highlighted limited resources for \u201cgender-responsive housing,\u201d and \u201ca place to land with wrap around services.\u201d There is no defined time limit for how long someone can stay, immediate access to health and mental health resources is critically important.<\/li>\n<li>Vinson highlighted the over-incarceration and limitations to housing access more broadly specifically for the individuals that are deemed \u201cinvaluable\u201d in society \u2013 calling it the \u201cover-incarceration of the marginalized.\u201d She recognized the larger challenges, like housing that \u201cdisproportionately impact\u201d those of marginalized groups even more.<\/li>\n<li>Rosales narrowed in on the simple act of believing in people and believing that they deserve second chances. She shared from her own professional experience that we can get caught in the loop of negativity and stigma, but we have to make the conscious effort to look at justice-involved individuals as people and for the successful individuals they can be as well.<\/li>\n<li>Bryant recognized that while being held responsible for our actions, we are part of this larger \u201cthing called humanity\u201d and the empathy and compassion that we have for the work we do is because we are, collectively \u201chumanity.\u201d He shared the quote that resonated with him while he was sentenced, \u201cTo go fast we go alone, to go far we go together.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Jha challenged the group and audience to reflect on the vulnerability and courage that comes from sharing and the fear we (in general) have with identifying with one another. She asked, \u201cWhat happens if we actually choose to identify with one another? Would that make these conversations actually easier? Do we feel that some of that tension of \u2018how will I be received\u2019 then becomes kind of normalized?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Collectively, the group shared their personal connections to the field and echoed the value about remembering where our individual compassion for this work comes from and being open to sharing our person experiences with mental health, substance use, and the justice system to help minimize the stigma that comes from having such experiences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Moderator Madhuri Jha LCSW, MPH closed out the webinar with sharing key takeaways from all the roundtables and thanking all the audience and panelists from the past five sessions for making this series successful. Key takeaways from the series included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A trauma informed system does not exist, but a trauma informed community does<\/li>\n<li>Successful and meaningful solutions to reducing rates of incarceration in our country must begin in the community and family<\/li>\n<li>These solutions must also be applied at a young age. We have to start seeing youth as potential to thrive from the beginning<\/li>\n<li>Our system truly has not treated all with the same compassion and rehabilitation<\/li>\n<li>Through our leaders of lived experience we broke down and dismantled misunderstanding, stereotypes, and stigma attached to being incarcerated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>For all media inquiries related to the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity, please contact kennedysatcher@msm.edu.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You can view a recording of the panel here: <\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/4EqR5jHoKOo\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/4EqR5jHoKOo<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Criminal Justice and Equity: Bridging the Gaps Webinar Series Overview \u201cCriminal Justice and Equity: Bridging the Gaps\u201d A five-part series of virtual roundtables dedicated to addressing the landscape of inequities that affect justice involved individuals.
