It is the type of mental image that stays with you forever in this line of work,\u201d said KSCMHE Director and practicing clinician, Madhuri Jha, LSCW, MPH, who is also spearheading this initiative. \u201cOur current psychiatric emergency response system fails to adequately meet the needs of our most vulnerable. For Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and other historically marginalized communities, 988 is an opportunity to ensure our system is saving and treating lives the way all humans deserve to be treated. From an evidence-based perspective, we will thoughtfully craft concrete and culturally responsive recommendations and evaluation measures to ensure that this significant moment in history advances equity the way it truly has the potential to do,\u201d emphasized Jha.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Embedding Equity into 988<\/em> will conduct a rapid academic review and survey assessment to inform a policy brief that will outline a series of detailed recommendations for effective and equitable administration of 988. This policy brief will be complemented with a virtual half-day leadership summit on June 21, 2022, where leaders in behavioral healthcare will discuss the equitable roll-out of 988 with the objective of defining strategies to address the unmet needs in crisis response, especially for historically marginalized people.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Satcher, former 16th U.S. Surgeon General and founder of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute shared, \u201cOver the years, I have seen people of color dismissed and not get the care they need or deserved. Our crisis and emergency response system simply does not know how to respond to diverse needs or are just negligent at times. This partnership and concentrated effort to make 988 equitable is bringing to light what is needed to respond and support the needs of all in a way that works. The goal for embedding equitable response structures into 988 is to truly provide our community members with the support they need versus doing more harm. This initiative and partnership aims to do just that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cActualizing equitable mental health service delivery is long overdue in our nation,\u201d stated former U.S. Rep. and co-founder of the Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity, Patrick J. Kennedy. \u201cAlthough having a dedicated crisis line for mental health emergencies is a major step in the right direction, ensuring we can provide the appropriate services to everyone, as part of its roll out, will be critical to its long-term success. I am grateful to Beacon Health Options for partnering with us to shine a spotlight on this issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis collaboration and initiative is a monumental opportunity for the advancement towards equitable healthcare for our nation. Structural barriers to equitable healthcare and the resulting inequities from these barriers, while daunting, are not permanent,\u201d said, Satcher Health Leadership Institute\u2019s Executive Director, Daniel Dawes, J.D. \u00a0\u201cThe work we are doing now to embed equity into the upcoming 988 crisis line is a leap towards dissolving these politically-determined barriers and the start to a more permanent, equitable, and holistic healthcare system.\u00a0 I am thrilled at the opportunity for the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Beacon Health Options to join forces in this important work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the nation moves closer to the national launch of 988, Beacon has been working closely with states to elevate the level of care they are able to provide through responsive crisis programs. Beacon\u2019s team of experts include individuals with clinical and lived experience to support people in crisis in communities across the country, working collaboratively to identify and address public health needs and build capacity of local resources.\u00a0 Together, they support people throughout their crisis journey and improve health equity for historically marginalized and underserved communities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeacon will continue to deliver capabilities that will help address gaps in services and resources in our communities,\u201d said Glenn MacFarlane, President, Beacon Health Options. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with KSCMHE on this initiative to ensure we are helping communities build better crisis systems based on a foundation of equity and capable of responding to the unique needs and experiences of each individual.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Kennedy-Satcher Center for Mental Health Equity (KSCMHE), an entity of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine, was jointly envisioned by the 16th U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, and former U.S. Representative Patrick J.
