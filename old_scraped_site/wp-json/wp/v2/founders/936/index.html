Kennedy"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Co-founder Patrick J. Kennedy has dedicated his life to improving the care, treatment, and public policies and understanding surrounding the issues of mental health and addiction in the United States and around the world.<\/p>\n<p>During his 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving Rhode Island\u2019s First Congressional District, Patrick J. Kennedy fought to end discrimination against those with mental illness, addiction, and other brain diseases. He is best known as the lead sponsor of the landmark Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (Federal Parity Law), which was passed with bi-partisan support and signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008. The Federal Parity Law provides millions of Americans, previously denied care, with access to mental health and addiction treatment by requiring insurance companies to cover treatment for mental health and substance use disorders no more restrictively than treatment for illnesses of the body, such as diabetes and cancer.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Federal Parity Law, Kennedy authored and co-sponsored dozens of bills during his time in Congress to increase the understanding and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including the Positive Aging Act; Foundations for Learning Act; National Neurotechnology Initiative Act; Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act; COMBAT PTSD Act; Nurse-Family Partnership Act; Alzheimer\u2019s Treatment and Caregiver Support Act; and Ready, Willing, and Able Act, which called on the Department of Homeland Security to deploy a civilian response system to blunt the psychological impact of terrorism. He served on various committees and subcommittees, including the House Appropriations Committee; the Subcommittee on Health, Education and Welfare; the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; and the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, he founded The Kennedy Forum, a non-profit organization whose mission is to lead a national dialogue on transforming mental health and addiction care delivery by uniting mental health advocates, business leaders, and government agencies around a common set of principles, including full implementation of the Federal Parity Law. The Forum aims to achieve health equity by advancing evidence-based practices, policies, political will, and programming in mental health and addiction treatment.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Kennedy co-authored the New York Times bestseller \u201cA Common Struggle\u201d in which he shares both his personal narrative and his experience shepherding the Federal Parity Law. The book ends with Kennedy\u2019s detailed roadmap to achieve health equity in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Kennedy served on the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. His personal contributions to the final report focused on the declaration of a federal emergency and strong parity-based recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Patrick J. Kennedy is also the creator of DontDenyMe.org, an educational campaign that empowers consumers and providers to understand parity rights and connects them to essential appeals guidance and resources; co-founder of One Mind, an organization that pushes for greater global investment in brain research; and co-chair of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention\u2019s Mental Health and Suicide Prevention National Response to COVID-19, which brings together public and private sectors to lead a coordinated mental health and suicide prevention response.<\/p>\n<p>Amid countless recognitions, meaningful partnerships, and political affiliations, Kennedy\u2019s most important achievement continues to be leveraging his family legacy in the arenas of civil rights, mental health, and intellectual disabilities to advance the cause of social justice and health equity for all people. He lives in New Jersey with his wife, Amy, and their children.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1171,"parent":0,"menu_order":10,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/kennedysatcher.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/founders\/936"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/kennedysatcher.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/founders"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/kennedysatcher.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/founders"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/kennedysatcher.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1171"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/kennedysatcher.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=936"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
